Monday- Module 1.
    1. We created a demo "hello World" web app, per tradition.
    2. For ease of use I moved this demo web app into an archives folder
        for future reference.
    3. Followed along with the lecture with minimal setbacks.
    4. Added 2 sample users with 6 different tweets using sqlite3
    Learning to use Flask is super exciting, I can't wait to see how
    it ties to Django in the future.
    I did not encounter any real challenges, I did get setback because I
    saved the "__init__" in the wrong place but after getting it into
    "TWITOFF" I was able to laucnh the flask shell and use DB to make the
    database.
