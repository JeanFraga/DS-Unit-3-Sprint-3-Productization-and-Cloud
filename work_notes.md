Monday- Module 1.
    1. We created a demo "hello World" web app, per tradition.
    2. For ease of use I moved this demo web app into an archives folder
        for future reference.
    3. Followed along with the lecture with minimal setbacks.
    4. Added 2 sample users with 6 different tweets using sqlite3
